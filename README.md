# Obs_Overlays
HTML overlays for OBS

The jquery.js file can be downloaded once and placed in the same location as any respective *.html file. 

The HTML files can be modified or updated as desired. All are built using basic HTML structure, CSS styling, and Javascript, leveraging jQuery for animation. The intended application is to use within OBS as a "browser" overlay, once donwloaded as a local file to your workstation.
